            <p class="conclusion-texto">In this activity, the use of languages for web page programming was put into 
                practice alongside their functional and aesthetic design for the comprehension of third parties. Visual elements 
                were used with CSS and the creation of the basic interface with HTML, allowing us to create a functional and 
                understandable web page that is also pleasing to the viewer's eye. This was to present a new important topic for understanding 
                the fundamentals of networking. This practice focused on ADSL and FTTH, investigating their functionalities and applications in 
                the field of networks, making a small implicit comparison of the advantages one may have over the other in terms of speed and 
                principles for managing and understanding the functionality of each.</p>

            <p class="conclusion-texto">The implementation of the web page creation practice was done 
                with HTML and CSS code that allowed me to more clearly understand the fundamental structure of a website. By 
                working with HTML, I understood how information is organized through tags and hierarchies, while with CSS I learned to style, 
                improve the visual appearance, and make the interface more attractive to the user. Additionally, with the research I conducted, I 
                realized that ADSL was a revolutionary technology that allowed access to broadband internet taking advantage of existing infrastructure, 
                but it is limited by the inherent restrictions of copper cable, and FTTH represents the natural evolution, overcoming all the limitations of 
                copper by using light and fiber optics, offering virtually unlimited 
                bandwidth, greater stability, and the symmetrical speeds necessary for the modern internet.</p>

            <p class="conclusion-texto">The development of a web page using HTML and CSS provided a 
                clearer understanding of a website's core architecture. 
                Working with HTML revealed how information is structured through elements and their hierarchy, 
                while CSS demonstrated how to apply style, enhance visual design, and create a more engaging user interface. 
                Furthermore, research showed that ADSL was a groundbreaking technology that enabled broadband internet by leveraging 
                existing infrastructure; however, it is constrained by the inherent limitations of copper wiring. In contrast, 
                FTTH represents the natural evolution, surpassing all copper restrictions by utilizing light signals through 
                fiber-optic cables. This technology offers nearly limitless bandwidth, superior stability, and the symmetrical 
                speeds essential for the modern internet.</p>

            <p class="conclusion-texto">In this exercise, the task was to create a web page to publish topics of interest. 
                On this occasion, the subject was ADSL and FTTH, as a way to broaden communication—a form of transmitting what we know 
                and what can be shared—since it is one of the most common ways to deliver information to people. Regarding the topic mentioned, these are forms or types of data transmission. The first is twisted pair, used in telephony, which works by 
                dividing the line into frequency ranges. 
                The second is fiber optic, which allows better information transmission and greater security, offering a significant improvement 
                compared to other technologies.</p>
