    <section class="contenido-principal">
        <h2>Principles of Operation of FTTH (Fiber to the Home) Technology</h2>
        
        <p>FTTH (Fiber to the Home) technology represents the ultimate evolution in telecommunications access networks, bringing optical fiber directly to the end-user's premises. Its operation is not based on electrical principles like ADSL or coaxial cable, but on optical principles and light modulation, which give it its superlative advantages in speed, capacity, and stability.</p>
        
        <p>The operating principle of an FTTH network can be broken down into four fundamental components:</p>
        
        <h3>1. Signal Transmission: Light Instead of Electricity</h3>
        <p>The fundamental principle that differentiates optical fiber is the use of light pulses (photons) to transmit information, instead of electrical signals. This light, typically generated by a laser or an LED at infrared wavelength (commonly 1310 nm, 1490 nm for data uplink/downlink, and 1550 nm for TV), is modulated to represent digital data (ones and zeros).</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>A "1" is represented by a pulse of light.</li>
            <li>A "0" is represented by the absence of light.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This encoding allows for extremely high operating frequencies (hundreds of terahertz), translating into enormous potential bandwidth.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Light Guiding: Total Internal Reflection</h3>
        <p>The light does not simply travel through the cable; it is guided with minimal loss thanks to the physical principle of Total Internal Reflection. This is achieved through the fiber's composition:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Core:</strong> This is the central zone through which the light travels. It is made of silica (glass) with a high refractive index.</li>
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Cladding:</strong> This surrounds the core and is made of a material with a slightly lower refractive index.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>This difference in the refractive index causes a light ray traveling through the core that hits the boundary with the cladding at a sufficiently steep angle to be completely reflected back into the core, without losing energy to the outside. This "perfect mirror" effect repeats along the entire fiber, confining the light and allowing it to travel kilometers with minimal attenuation (signal loss).</p>
        
        <h3>3. Network Architecture: Point to Multi-Point (P2MP)</h3>
        <p>An FTTH network is not a single continuous fiber from the central office to each home. Its architecture is P2MP (Point-to-Multipoint), commonly implemented with a GPON (Gigabit-capable Passive Optical Network) topology. This architecture is based on the use of passive components (which do not require electrical power) to split the signal, making the network highly efficient and reliable.</p>
        
        <p>The operational flow is as follows:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>OLT (Optical Line Terminal):</strong> Located in the operator's central office, it is the active "brain" of the network. It converts the electrical data from the internet backbone into optical signals and transmits them downstream to users. It also receives and processes upstream signals from them.</li>
            
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Optical Fiber:</strong> The optical signal travels from the OLT over a trunk fiber that extends into the neighborhood.</li>
            
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Passive Splitters:</strong> These are purely optical, passive devices. They are installed in strategic points (street cabinets, manholes) and their function is to split the power of the light signal from the trunk fiber into multiple identical beams, each directed to a different home. A splitter can divide the signal among 32, 64, or even 128 users. This drastically reduces the amount of fiber needed from the central office.</li>
            
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>ONU/ONT (Optical Network Unit / Terminal):</strong> This is the active device installed in the user's home. It is the equivalent of a modem in other technologies. Its critical function is:
                <ul>
                    <li>To receive the downstream optical signal, demodulate it (convert the light pulses back into electrical data), and distribute it via Ethernet or Wi-Fi to the user's devices.</li>
                    <li>To receive electrical data from the user's devices, modulate it (convert it into light pulses), and transmit it upstream over the fiber towards the OLT.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4. Full-Duplex Communication: TDD (Time Division Duplex)</h3>
        <p>For uplink (upload) and downlink (download) data to occur on the same fiber without interference, GPON technology uses a multiplexing scheme.</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Downstream (from OLT to ONT):</strong> The OLT transmits a continuous optical signal that is received by all ONTs connected to the same splitter. Each ONT identifies and decodes only the data packets intended for it, ignoring the rest, based on a unique identifier (GEMPORT).</li>
            
            <li><span class="numero-lista">•</span> <strong>Upstream (from ONT to OLT):</strong> Here, the TDD (Time Division Duplex) principle is applied. The OLT assigns specific and very precise time slots to each ONT. Each terminal can only transmit its light pulses back to the network in its assigned time slot. This prevents signals from different users from colliding in the splitter on their way back to the OLT. The OLT orchestrates this process centrally.</li>
        </ul>
